# ðŸŽµ Music Skip Prediction

This project explores the development of machine learning models to predict **whether a user will skip a track** on a music streaming platform based on audio features and user behavior data.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Predict skip behavior using time-series or deep learning models (RNN, Transformer).
- Analyze how acoustic properties like tempo, mood, and energy affect skipping.
- Optionally: compare sober vs. intoxicated listener reactions (future scope).
